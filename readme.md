# The Elder Engine

The Elder Engine is a game engine based on Eldritch, a 2013 first-person roguelike made by Minor Key Games.

## Why Fork

The engine behind Eldritch is remarkably elegant for its simplicity.
The game itself is short, but has very high replay value, and is sheer _fun_.

With some changes, this engine can be something truly great.

Intended new features:

- creature meshes and textures into sub-folders that can be loaded at runtime
- Lua Scripting Support(special thanks to the the author of mEldritch)
- a level editor

Another reason to fork is that I have an idea for a game, `Post-Atomic`, that would fit quite well into this engine.
